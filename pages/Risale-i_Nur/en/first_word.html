    <h1>Risale-i Nur — The First Word</h1>
    <h2>﷽</h2>

    <b>In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, and in Him we seek help</b>

    <b>
      Praise be to Allah, Lord of the worlds, and blessings and peace upon
      our Master Muhammad and upon all his family and companions.
    </b>

    <p>
      O brother! You asked me for some advice. Since you are a soldier, listen
      to some truths with me through eight little stories using military
      <span class="tooltip"
        >similes
        <span class="tooltiptext">similes: examples or analogies</span> </span
      >. Because I see that I myself need advice more than anyone else. In the past,
      I addressed my soul at length with "The Eight Words" which I derived from
      eight verses. Now, I will speak briefly and in simple language to my soul.
      Whoever wants to, let them listen along.
    </p>

    <h3>THE FIRST WORD</h3>

    <p>
      “Bismillah” (In the name of Allah) is the beginning of all good. We too begin with it.
      Know, my soul! This blessed phrase is not only the symbol of Islam, but
      also the continual invocation in the language of all existence. If you want to
      understand what a great, inexhaustible power and endless blessing
      “Bismillah” is, look and listen to the following
      <span class="tooltip"
        >illustrative
        <span class="tooltiptext">illustrative: example, analogy</span>
      </span>
      story:
    </p>

    <p>
      Suppose a man traveling in the Bedouin deserts must take the name of a tribal
      chief and come under his protection so that he may be saved from the
      evildoers and meet his needs. Otherwise, he would be alone against countless
      enemies and would be miserable.
    </p>

    <p>
      For such a journey, two men set out into the desert. One was
      <span class="tooltip"
        >humble
        <span class="tooltiptext">humble: modest</span>
      </span>
      and the other was
      <span class="tooltip"
        >proud
        <span class="tooltiptext">proud: arrogant, conceited</span> </span
      >. The humble one took the name of a chief, the proud one did not. The one
      who took it traveled safely everywhere. If he met a
      <span class="tooltip"
        >highwayman
        <span class="tooltiptext">highwayman: bandit, robber</span>
      </span>
      he would say, “I travel under the name of so-and-so chief.” The evildoers
      would avoid him and not bother him. If he entered a tent, he would be
      respected because of that name. The proud one suffered so many troubles on
      his journey that they are indescribable. He was always trembling and always
      begging. He became both lowly and disgraced.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, O proud soul! You are that traveler. This world is a desert. Your
      weakness and poverty are limitless.
    </p>

    <h4>PAGE 2</h4>

    <p>
      Your enemies and needs are endless. Since this is so, take the name of the
      <span class="tooltip"
        >Eternal Owner
        <span class="tooltiptext">Eternal Owner: Allah</span>
      </span>
      of this desert and
      the <span class="tooltip"
        >Everlasting Judge
        <span class="tooltiptext">Everlasting Judge: Allah</span>
      </span>
      so that you may be saved from the begging of the entire universe and not
      tremble before any event.
    </p>

    <p>
      Indeed, this phrase is such a blessed treasure that it binds your
      infinite weakness and poverty to infinite power and mercy of
      <span class="tooltip"
        >The All-Powerful, The Merciful
        <span class="tooltiptext">
          The All-Powerful, The Merciful: Allah
        </span>
      </span>
      and makes your weakness and poverty the most accepted intercessor in His presence.
      Yes, he who acts with this phrase is like one who enlists as a soldier.
      He acts in the name of the state. He fears no one. He says “In the name of
      the law, in the name of the state” and does every job and endures everything.
    </p>

    <p>
      As we said at the beginning: All existence, in its language, says “Bismillah.”
      Is that so?
    </p>

    <p>
      Yes, just as you might see a man come and forcefully move all the city’s
      people somewhere and make them work involuntarily, you know well that
      the man is not acting by his own name or power. Rather, he is a soldier
      acting on behalf of the state’s power.
    </p>

    <p>
      So too, everything acts in the name of Allah, as tiny particles like
      seeds carry big trees, lifting heavy loads. This means every tree says
      “Bismillah.” They fill their hands with the fruits from the treasure of mercy.
      They serve us.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every garden says “Bismillah.” From the
      <span class="tooltip"
        >Kitchen of Power
        <span class="tooltiptext">Kitchen of Power: The power’s source</span>
      </span>
      comes a pot cooking many kinds of delicious dishes together. Every blessed
      animal such as cows, camels, sheep, and goats say “Bismillah.” They become
      fountains of milk from the mercy’s bounty. They offer us food as
      <span class="tooltip"
        >The Provider
        <span class="tooltiptext">The Provider: Allah</span>
      </span>
      in the most delicate and pure form, like water of life.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every plant, tree, and grass with silk-like soft roots and veins say “Bismillah.”
      They pierce through hard stones and soil. They say “In the name of Allah, in the name
      of the Most Merciful.” Everything is made subservient to them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Indeed, like the spreading of branches in the air and bearing fruit, the
      roots in hard stones and soil spread with great ease and bear fruit
      underground; the soft green leaves remain alive for months against the
      intense heat, striking nature’s face like a hard slap, poking its blind eye,
      saying:
    </p>

    <p>
      Even the strongest firmness and heat you rely on moves under command;
      those silk-like soft veins act like
      <span class="tooltip"
        >Moses’ Staff (as)
        <span class="tooltiptext">Moses’ Staff (as): The staff of Prophet Moses</span>
      </span>
      following the command
      <span
        dir="rtl"
        class="tooltip"
        title="فَاضْرِبْ بِعَصَاكَ الْحَجَرَ (From the Quran): Strike the rock with your staff"
        >فَاضْرِبْ بِعَصَاكَ الْحَجَرَ</span
      >
      and split the stones.
    </p>

    <p>
      And those delicate leaves, as thin as cigarette paper, act like the limbs
      of
      <span class="tooltip"
        >Abraham (as)
        <span class="tooltiptext">Abraham (as): Prophet Abraham</span>
      </span>
      who recite the verse
      <span
        dir="rtl"
        class="tooltip"
        title="يَا نَارُ كُون۪ي بَرْدًا وَسَلَامًا (From the Quran): O fire, be cool and peaceful"
        >يَا نَارُ كُون۪ي بَرْدًا وَسَلَامًا</span
      >
      against the burning heat.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since everything essentially says “Bismillah,” they bring Allah’s blessings
      to us. We too must say “Bismillah.” We must give in the name of Allah and
      take in the name of Allah. Therefore, we should not accept from heedless
      people who do not give in the name of Allah.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Question:</strong> We give a price to those who act as dealers. What
      would the real owner of the goods, Allah, receive in return?
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Answer:</strong> The one who does not give his property is a thief,
      the one who gives is a beggar. The one who gives the real essence of his
      property is
      <span class="tooltip">truthful and generous</span>
      and is the true owner of the dominion.
